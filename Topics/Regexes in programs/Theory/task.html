Regular expressions are a powerful tool for processing strings in Java, as they allow you to define common patterns using regular characters and special characters, and then check whether strings match these patterns.">Regular expressions</a> have a very wide scope of application.

Java has its own specific syntax, which includes the use of keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and separators. These tokens must adhere to the specific rules of the Java syntax and are separated by whitespace.">syntax</a> highlighting, for extraction of useful information from files and web sites. In this lesson, we would like to show you an example of a simple yet powerful program using a regular expression for string processing.</p>
<h5 id="program-with-a-regular-expression" style="text-align: center;">Program with a regular expression </h5>
<p>Let's consider a program that checks whether the input string is a valid login. We assume that login can contain any Latin letter, a number, the underscore character <code class="language-java">_</code>, and the dollar sign <code class="language-java">$</code>. The length must be no less than 5 characters and no more than 12 characters.</p>
<p>There is one additional feature: we should ignore all whitespace characters in the beginning and the end of the input string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

class CheckLoginProblem {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

       /* The scanner object to read data from the standard input */
       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       
       /* The common pattern for valid logins */
       String loginRegex = "\\s*[a-zA-Z0-9_$]{5,12}\\s*";

       /* The read string which may be a login */
       String mayBeLogin = scanner.nextLine();

       boolean isLogin = mayBeLogin.matches(loginRegex);

       System.out.println(isLogin);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember, the regex <code class="language-java">"\\s*"</code> is a very useful practical tool for finding whitespace characters. It's preferable to use this shorthand instead of directly typing <code class="language-java">" "</code>.</p>
<p>Let's try different inputs and test our program.</p>
<p><strong>The input-output pair 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">  testuser7
true</code></pre>
<p><strong>The input-output pair 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java"> test  
false</code></pre>
<p><strong>The input-output pair 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">      user!!!
false</code></pre>
<p><strong>The input-output pair 4:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-java">$test_user
true</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, by using a simple regular expression we can write a quite powerful program for a real-life problem. If you wish, you can rewrite this regex using other <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3696" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, special characters, also known as meta-characters, are characters that have a specific meaning or function in regular expressions. | They are used to define patterns that can match multiple different strings at once. For example, the dot (.) special character matches any single character, including letters, digits, spaces, and others, but it cannot match the newline character. Another example is the question mark (? ), which is a special character that means the preceding character or nothing. It is often used to match words with slightly different spellings in American and British English.">special characters</a>.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this lesson, we've seen a small example of how regular expressions can help us in string processing. You can experiment further and implement other regular expressions to check whether the login meets stricter requirements.</p>
